1.Create a view showing the values of the product on hand.

db.createView("ProductOnHand", "product",
    [ { $project:{ "name:", $multiply: [ "price:", "qty:" ] } } ]
    );

Having syntax issues with this question.

***********
2.Select all the products and the category that the product is in.
How many collections needed to be joined to recover the data?
 
 Would need to srt by category first.
 
db.createView("ProductsInCategory", "product",
    [ { $project:{ "name", "category"} } ]
    );
    
More syntax issues.
We would need the product names and the product categories but they all come
from the same collection.

3. Select the product name and the category name of all the products.

db.createView("ProductandCategory", "product",
    [ { $project:{ "name", "category"} } ]
    );
************
4. Select all the products, the categories they belong to, and the company the product is made by.
